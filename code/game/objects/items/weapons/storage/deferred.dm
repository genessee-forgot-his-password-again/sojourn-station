/*
	Deferred spawn storage containers
*/

/*
	These are a special type of storage container used for less-accessed gear. They create their contents through a
	spawn_contents proc which is called the first time the box is opened or interacted with.

	The key thing here is, these contents are not spawned at roundstart, only when a player actually needs them
	And thusly, if no player ever does, then those items are not sitting around wasting memory and CPU time

	Most of the things in this file are intended for use by external antags, and are thus exceptionally powerful

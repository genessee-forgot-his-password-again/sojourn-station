	First thing first, click that button to detect the turbines, there should be ten of them. From that point onward it will be a waiting game. \
	The holding basin is pretty massive and the flowing power of the river can vary, so it may take a while for it to fill up. \
	You'll get a nifty notice over the radio communication channel once it's full. That would be the best time to open up the flood gates and start the turbines. \
	Water will start flowing and power will start being generated. Once it empties out it'll start filling back up on its own. \
	In the very rare case of a malfunction you'll have to suit up and head out to see what's wrong. You may have to use a multitool to \
	fix a stalled out engine or crowbar out some debris that gets stuck in. They'll have a red warning glow if malfunctioning. Good luck. -Sieghardt Meldurson.</p>"

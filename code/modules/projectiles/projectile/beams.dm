/*
Beams, they are rather harder to get armor against and dont have bullet drop off.
Thus they are objectively always going to be outclassed by bullets in their idea use.
Beams also can pass thought glass and are hitscan, thus making them great against most problems.
In pvp they also have more lasting damages, such as infections, and pain form burns.

			While the common akula is strong, most gangers train themselves in the 'honorable' way of fighting, favoring melee. Fixing up their bikes so often has also given them some mechanical knack.  \
			Days and weeks of patching themselves up after a bar fight or gang-land style shooting have made most pretty self reliant but, sadly even the clever gangers eventually get caught. \
			While criminal backgrounds are often overlooked, yours is one of public record and far more brutal than most, made known by either your boasting, tattoos, or records. \
			Security is still willing to hire you, but your records should note your history."

			Service in the military, however, has its draw backs. Much of an akula's training is steeped solely in marksmanship as they cannot keep pace with the faster naramads and must take \

			While impressive, this position strains even the well known toughness of most akula and leaves them with lasting injuries. \
			The training breachers get is also exclusive, focused entirely on melee assisted by large shields as a hulking charging akula rushing a position attracts more concentrated \
			fire, thus freeing up the soldiers in the back to make clear picked shots."
